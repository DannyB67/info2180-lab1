        <h2>Daniel Bingham</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Daniel. I’m the kind of person who’s always chasing ideas—whether it’s cracking a tough algorithm, </br>
writing eerie short stories, or diving into the logic behind probability puzzles. I go to school not just to learn, </br>
but to explore. I love breaking things down, figuring out how they work, and then building something new from the pieces.</br>
You’ll usually find me tinkering with code, sketching out storylines, or asking way too many questions in class. I’m methodical,</br>
curious, and a little obsessed with clarity—whether in my writing or my programming. One area I’ve grown especially passionate about is web development, </br>
because it blends structure with creativity and lets me shape user experiences through both design and logic. It’s like storytelling through interaction, </br>
where every element on the page has meaning and every line of code contributes to something people can actually use. If there’s a challenge, </br>
I’m not backing down until I understand it inside out.</p>
